# Classifying Cellular Automata using Machine Learning

Projects done at the [Wolfram Summer School'16](https://education.wolfram.com/summer/school/alumni/2016/shah/) and under various Wolfram Mentorship programs after that.


Previous projects: Focusing on studying cellular automata behavior and classifying them using both supervised(NN) and unsupervised learning methods.

Current Project: Studying algorithmic complexity of Neural Networks.
